# Learning Spring Boot 🚀  

Welcome to my journey of learning **Spring Boot**! This repository documents the steps, projects, and resources I use as I explore this powerful framework for building robust and scalable Java applications.

## 🌟 About Spring Boot  
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create microservices and stand-alone applications with minimal setup. It simplifies Spring-based applications by eliminating boilerplate code and configuration.  

Key Features:  
- **Auto-configuration**  
- **Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)**  
- **Spring Boot CLI**  
- **Production-ready features (Monitoring, Health Checks, etc.)**

## 📚 Learning Goals  
1. Understand the basics of Spring Boot.  
2. Explore dependency injection and the Spring IoC container.  
3. Implement REST APIs with Spring Boot.  
4. Learn database integration using Spring Data JPA.  
5. Understand application security with Spring Security.  
6. Deploy Spring Boot applications.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies  
- **Java 21**  
- **Maven** (Build Tool)  
- **Spring Boot**  
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse  

---

## 📖 Topics Covered  
- **Getting Started**: Setting up a Spring Boot project using Maven.  
- **Annotations**: Exploring key annotations like `@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, etc.  
- **Dependency Injection**: Learning how Spring Boot manages dependencies.  
- **Database Integration**: Using Spring Data JPA for database operations.
